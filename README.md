# Advent Of Code

## Add Yourself To The Repo

Once you've been given admin access to the repo do the following:

1. create a folder under the current year with your name/github username
1. list yourself in `.github/CODEOWNERS` so that you get notified when someone posts a solution
1. create PRs to merge your solution so everyone gets a chance to check it out
